# UFOs

# Overview 
These are documents needed to create a web application displaying top strories of Unidentifed Flying Objects, or UFO's using JavaScript. This is a website providing an in depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing a user to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. We filter the data of UFO sightings for the city, state, country, and shape of the UFO. 

# Summary
The files in this repository are the files required to build the UFO website. The first thing to do is to open the file "index.html" on your web browser. This will open to the main page of the website.

The first things users read is the about section of the web page, appearing at the upper right hand side of the page. 

The next thing the user might notice is the four text boxes apperaing above the left hand side of the UFO sightings table. These are the options to filter the UFO sighings data to the users preference.
