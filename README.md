# UFOs

# Overview 
These are documents needed to create a web application displaying top strories of Unidentifed Flying Objects, or UFO's using JavaScript. This is a website providing an in depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing a user to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. We filter the data of UFO sightings for the city, state, country, and shape of the UFO. 

# Results
The files in this repository are the files required to build the UFO website. The first thing to do is to open the file "index.html" on your web browser. This will open to the main page of the website.

The first things users read is the about section of the web page, appearing at the upper right hand side of the page. 

The next thing the user might notice is the four text boxes apperaing above the left hand side of the UFO sightings table. These are the options to filter the UFO sighings data to the users preference. 

A user could filter this data by state. Let's say the user enters the state of California, labeled as "ca". The website will display UFO sights recorded on the day the user entered into the state. In this case, the data is filtered to UFO sightings located in California. The website with the filter included is shown below.

A user could also add another filter, such as filtering the data by the shape of the object. A user can type in "triangle" in the shape text box, this is what the website looks like with just the shape filter applied only.

A user can add multiple filters to the text boxes provided in the upper left side above the table. For example, a user can enter in UFO's that were found in California that were the shapes of triangles. Here is what the website looks like with those filters added on.

# Summary

The one drawback from building this website is there are not enough Bootstrap elements to refine this website and also make the website readable to the user. There is also not enough data to make this website stand out as well. It would be necessecary to extract UFO sightings from multiple days, or from different countries as well. There are numerous reccomendations to improve and refine this website. The first is get more data from a creditable organization that focuses UFO's, such as the SETI Institute (Search For Extraterrestrial Intellengce). This way, the website will look professional and more reliable for a user to get crediable information about UFO sightings in their area. 

The second reccomendation is to get a better description of the shape of the UFO. In the dataset provided under the file "data.js", there were UFO's whose shape were labeled as "unknown" or "other". It seems redundent information and a user would like to know more about the shape of the UFO. A user might think if the UFO is a shape of a circle, a sphere, or an exotic shape like a Mobius Strip?
